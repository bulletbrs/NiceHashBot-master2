NHB3 is proof of concept (but working) application. It is some how extension of rest-clients-demo (https://github.com/nicehash/rest-clients-demo) and can be used *as is* or upgraded for further improvements in usability and functionality. 
Main purpose is to demonstrate interaction with new NiceHash platform.

NHB3 uses two classes for interaction with NiceHash platform **Api.cs** that prepares all required request headers (authorization - as described here - https://docs.nicehash.com/) and executes remote calls and **ApiConnect.cs** that exposes methods for actions used by NHB3.

Majority of BOT logic is in function **runBot()** inside Home.cs class witch is executed once per minute and then check if order needs some sort of interaction (refill, increase speed or decrease speed).
